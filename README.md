  <h3>Upload Modal</h3>

</p>
<p>Creating this upload modal was an exciting part of the project! It involved learning more about both the backend (video hosting) AND the frontend (conditional rendering and styling). It also required lots of fun conditional logic to make things appear/disappear/update/and persist in order to complete the full upload process.
<br /><br />
I learned and was able to implement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conditional React component rendering to make the modal appear/disappear</li>
  <li>CSS modal overlay and styling</li>
  <li>React event handling and HTML file-type inputs to implement drag and drop</li>
  <li>Utilizing local state to autofill and persist data between multiple screens/steps</li>
  <li>Combining Rails ActiveStorage with my ActiveRecord models</li>
  <li>Connecting database with AWS image and video hosting</li>
</ul><br />
